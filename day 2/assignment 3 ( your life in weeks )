Instructions:-

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us
how many days, weeks, months.
we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input 
and output a message with our time left
in this format:[You have x days, y weeks, and z months left].

Example Input
56

Example Output
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.

hint:-
1year = 365 days
1year = 52 weeks
1year = 12 months

Practice Code:-

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
total_age = 90
left_age = total_age - int(age)

days = 365 * left_age
weeks = 52 * left_age
months = 12 * left_age

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
