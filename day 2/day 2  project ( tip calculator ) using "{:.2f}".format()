Instruction :-

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
Note:-
bill - could be $x amount
people - could be y
tip could be 10%,12% or 15%

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

practice code :-

print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")

bill = float(input("what was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input(" How much tip would you like to give? 10,12, or 15 ? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))

tip_perc = tip / 100
total_tip = bill * tip_perc 
total_bill = bill + total_tip
pay = total_bill / people
bill_per_person = "{:.2f}".format(pay)

print(f"Each person Should Pay : ${bill_per_person}")
