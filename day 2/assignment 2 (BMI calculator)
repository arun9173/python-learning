Instructions:-

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

formula:
BMI = weight(kg)/height*height

Example Input
weight = 80
height = 1.75

Example Output
80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837
output=26

practice code:-

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
h=float(height)
w=float(weight)
BMI = w/(h**2)
# print(type(h))
# print(type(w))
print(int(BMI))
