***using split(", ") we can generate list of item separated by ','.***
eg.:-

names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma.\n ")
names = names_string.split(",")
print(names)

output sample:

Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma.
arun,neeraj,niruktt,kannu
['arun','neeraj','niruktt','kannu']
